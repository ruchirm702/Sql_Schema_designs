# Database Schema Designs

Welcome to the Database Schema Designs repository! This repository contains a collection of well-structured and optimized database schema designs for various use cases.

## What is Schema Design?

Schema design refers to the process of defining the structure of a database, including the tables, fields, relationships, and constraints that organize and store data. A well-designed schema ensures efficient data retrieval, storage, and management while maintaining data integrity and reducing redundancy. Good schema design follows best practices such as normalization to minimize redundancy and optimize performance.
